# Nasa-API-Website
The website was made for my Web Development I class in order to understand how to use APIs correctly. It taught me how to utilitze JSON files, as well as how to properly incorporate that info. The API it uses is from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, a repository of data that is open to the public.

How to Install:
1. Install PyCharm (I used the Community Edition, with the version being available from 2024.2.3)
2. Open the NASAWebsiteAPI file in the IDE
3. Run from the app.py screen
4. If the website does not seem to be working, install an extension to unblock CORS (I used CORS Unblock on Chrome).

Usage:
- This website takes in a date to pull the Astronomy Picture of the Day from that specific time.
- To use, just input the date and click the button.
- If there is a corresponding picture, it should be loaded alongside its title and description.
- If there is not a corresponding picture, the website will simply say "BAD REQUEST"

Features:
- This is an incredibly simple website, not even implementing stylistic elements.
- The most complex element is the communication with NASA's API, which is still pretty rudimentary.
